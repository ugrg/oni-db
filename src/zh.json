  "Well, mentorship hasn't gone quite how I'd expected. Turns out the young hires don't need me to show them the ropes. Actually, since the facility's gotten rid of our swipe cards one of the nice young men had to show me how to operate the doors after I got stuck outside my own lab. Don't I feel silly.\n------------------\n": "好吧，指导工作并没有像我预期的那样发展。事实证明，这些年轻的员工并不需要我向他们展示各种技巧。实际上，由于研究所不再使用刷卡进入的做法，我曾经被拦在了自己的实验室外面进不去，导致我不得不向一位好心的年轻人请教如何开门。我是不是看起来很愚蠢呢？\n------------------\n",
  "Well, if that isn't just gravy, hm? One of the new hires will be acting as the team lead on my next project.  When I first started it wasn't that uncommon to sample a whole rack of test tubes by hand. Now a machine can do hundreds of them in seconds. Who knows what this job will look like in another ten or twenty years. Will I still even be in it?\n------------------\n": "好吧，那可能不是唯一令人尴尬的地方，对吧？其中一名新员工将在我的下一个项目中担任团队负责人。  当我刚开始的时候，亲手取样一整排试管样品的做法都是很寻常的事。但现在，一台机器可以在几秒钟之内完成数百支试管的采样工作。谁知道在下一个10年或20年之后，这份工作又会变成什么样子。那个时候，我还会在这里吗？\n------------------\n",

If that isn't a chuckle. At any rate, I feel like I have a better handle on things around here due to Mr. Kraus' help. Turns out you're never too old to learn something new!\n------------------\n": "那位曾在前几天帮我开门的好心年轻人，克劳斯先生，他绝对是一个天使。他人真的很好，帮我处理了这个麻烦的电子邮件系统，甚至还教会了我如何将研究笔记数字化。我从他那里学到了很多东西。结果，我并不是指导者，而是被指导者！如果不会被嘲笑的话，我愿意承认此事。不管怎样，因为克劳斯的帮助，我觉得现在的我能够更好地处理这里的事情。事实证明，活到老学到老！\n------------------\n",

Hibiscus quickly learned that pulling the lever to the left produced no results, and was reliably demonstrating the desired behavior by the end of the first week.  Training continued for one additional week to strengthen neural pathways and ensure the intended behavioral conditioning was committed to long term and muscle memory.  Cloning subject #762, \"Hibiscus-3\", was introduced to the lever apparatus to ascertain memory retention and recall.  Hibiscus-3 showed no signs of recognition and did not perform the desired behavior. Subject initially failed to interact with the apparatus on any level.  On second introduction, Hibiscus-3 pulled the lever to the left.  Conclusion: Printed subject retains no memory from donor.": "猜想：从芙蓉克隆的实验体可在初次接触时正确操作控制杆装置，展现其保留了原始提供体的条件刺激记忆。  提供体 #650，\"芙蓉\"，在条件刺激下将控制杆拉到右侧以得到奖励（杏仁）。训练时间为期两周。  芙蓉迅速得知将控制杆拉到左侧没有结果，并在第一周结束之前便能够可靠地展现预期的行为。  训练再继续一周以强化神经通路并确保预期的行为训练有助于长期和肌肉记忆。  让克隆的实验体 #762，\"芙蓉-3号\"接触控制杆装置，以便确定记忆保留和唤回情况。  芙蓉-3号没有显示认出该装置的迹象，并且没有执行预期的行为。实验体最初未能与该装置进行任何层级的交互。  在第二次接触时，芙蓉-3号将控制杆拉到了左侧。  结论：打印的实验体没有保留来自提供体的任何记忆。",

  "We've successfully compressed and expanded small portions of time under .03 milliseconds. This proves that time is something that can be physically acted upon, suggesting that our vision is attainable.  An unintentional consequence of both the expansion and contraction of time is the creation of a \"vacuum\" in the space between the affected portion of time and the much more expansive unaffected portions.  So far, we are seeing that the unaffected time on either side of the manipulated portion will expand or contract to fill the vacuum, although we are unsure how far-reaching this consequence is or what effect it has on the laws of the natural universe. At the end of all compression and expansion experiments, alterations to time are undone and leave no lasting change.": "我们成功地实现了0.03毫秒以下的小段时间的压缩和膨胀。这证明时间是一种可以进行物理操作的东西，所以我们的愿景是可以实现的。  时间膨胀和收缩的一个意外结果是，受影响的时间部分与未受影响的更大的时间部分之间会产生一个\"真空\"产物。  到目前为止，我们看到，处理部分两侧的未受影响的时间都会扩大或收缩以弥补这种真空，但我们不确定这种结果的影响会有多深远，也不确定它会给自然宇宙的规律带来什么影响。在所有压缩和膨胀实验结束时，我们都会撤销对时间的更改，不会留下持久的改变。",

  "When we discuss Time as a concrete aspect of the universe, not seconds on a clock or perceptions of the mind, it is important first of all to establish that we are talking about a unique dimension that layers into the three physical dimensions of space: length, width, depth.  We conceive of Real Time as a straight line, one dimensional, uncurved and stretching forward infinitely. This is referred to as the \"Arrow of Time\".  Logically this Arrow can move only forward and can never be reversed, as such a reversal would break the natural laws of the universe. Effect would precede cause and universal entropy would be undone in a blatant violation of the Second Law.  Still, one can't help but wonder; what if the Arrow's trajectory could be curved?

It is a device which manipulates the 4th dimension to generate infinite, clean and renewable energy.  While it may sound like something from science fiction, facility founder Dr. Jacquelyn Stern confirms that it is very much real.  \"It has already been demonstrated that Newton's Second Law of Motion can be violated by negative mass superfluids under the correct lab conditions,\" she says.  \"If the Laws of Motion can be bent and altered, why not the Laws of Thermodynamics? That was the main intent behind this project.\"  The Temporal Bow works by rapidly vibrating sections of the 4th dimension to send small quantities of mass forward and backward in time, generating massive amounts of energy with virtually no waste.  \"The fantastic thing about using the 4th dimension as fuel,\" says Stern, \"is that it is really, categorically infinite\".  For those eagerly awaiting the prospect of human time travel, don't get your hopes up just yet. The Facility says that although they have successfully transported matter through time, the technology was expressly developed for the purpose of energy generation and is ill-equipped for human transportation.": "最近成立的庄严科技的科学家们公布了他们的第一个技术原型，称为\"时空之弓\"，这是一种能够操纵第四维度，生成无限、清洁、可再生能源的装置。  虽然这听起来可能像科幻小说中的情节，但研究所创始人杰奎琳·斯特恩博士证实，这是千真万确的。  \"目前我们已经证明，在适当的实验室条件下，负质量超流体是可以违反牛顿第二运动定律的，\"她说。  \"既然运动定律可以被弯曲和改变，为什么热力学定律不能呢？这就是这个项目的主要目的。\"  时空之弓的工作原理是，通过快速振动第四维度的节段，在时间上向前和向后发送少量的质量，从而产生大量的能量，几乎没有浪费。  \"使用第四维度作为燃料最好的地方在于，\"斯特恩说道，\"它是绝对无限的\"。  对于那些急切期待人类时间旅行前景的人，现在还是不要抱太大希望。研究所表示，尽管他们已经成功通过时间传送了物质，但这项技术是专为发电而发明的，若作为传送人类的设备还存在不足。",

  "The first experiments with establishing a colony off planet were an unmitigated disaster. Without outside help, our current Artificial Intelligence was completely incapable of making the kind of spontaneous decisions needed to deal with unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, the colony subjects lacked the forethought to even build themselves toilet facilities, even after soiling themselves repeatedly.  While initial experiments in a lab setting were encouraging, our latest operation on non-Terra soil revealed some massive inadequacies to our system. If this idea is ever going to work, we will either need to drastically improve the AI directing the subjects, or improve the brains of our Duplicants to the point where they possess higher cognitive functions.  Given the disastrous complications that I could foresee arising if our Duplicants were made less supplicant, I'm leaning toward a push to improve our Artificial Intellegence.  Meanwhile, we will have to send a clean-up crew to destroy all evidence of our little experiment beneath the Ceres' surface. We can't risk anyone discovering the remnants of our failed colony, even if that's unlikely to happen for another few decades at least.  (Sometimes it boggles my mind how much further behind Gravitas the rest of the world is.)": "首次在外星建立殖民地的实验简直是一场不折不扣的灾难。在没有外部帮助的情况下，我们当前的人工智能完全无法做出应对不可预见的状况的自发决策。此外，殖民地的实验体缺乏主观能动力，即使反复把自己弄脏也不知道建造厕所设施。  虽然最初在实验室环境中的实验很成功，但我们上一次在非类地土壤上的实验揭示了我们的系统存在一些巨大的缺陷。我们如果仍想继续这个计划，要么对人工智能进行大规模的调整以指导实验体，要么改进我们复制人的大脑，使他们拥有更高的认知能力。  如果我们的复制人做成更主动的，那么我能预见到未来会引发灾难性的问题，所以我更倾向于提高我们人工智能的水平。  同时，我们不得不派出清理人员来摧毁我们在谷神星地表之下做实验的证据。我们不能冒风险让其他人发现我们失败殖民地的遗迹，即使这种事情在至少几十年内都几乎不可能发生。  （有时我会感到困惑，世界的剩余部分离庄严科技有多远呢。）",
  "We have been successfully using the Temporal Bow now for some time with no obvious consequences. I should be happy that this works so well, but several questions gnaw at my brain late at night.  If Time's Arrow is moving forward the Laws of Entropy declare that the universe should be moving from a state of order to one of chaos. If the Temporal Bow bends to a previous point in time to a point when things were more orderly, logic would dictate that we are making this point more chaotic by taking things from it. All known laws of the natural universe suggests that this should have affected our Present Day, but all evidence points to that not being true. It appears the theory that we cannot change our past was incorrect!  This suggests that Time is, in fact, not an arrow but several arrows, each pointing different directions. Fundamentally, this proves the existence of other timelines - different dimensions - some of which we can assume have also built their own Temporal Bow.  The promise of crossing this final dimensional threshold is too tempting. Imagine what things Gravitas has invented in another dimension!! I must find a way to tear open the fabric of spacetime and tap into the limitless human potential of a thousand alternate timelines.": "现在我们已经成功使用时空之弓有一段时间了，而且没有明显的后果。我应该对此感到高兴，但仍有几个问题在深夜使我难以入眠。  如果时间之箭是向前运动的，那么根据熵定律，宇宙应该从有序变为无序。如果时空之弓将以前的时间点弯向更有序的时间点，逻辑上因为我们从中拿了东西，那么这个时间点就会变得更加无序。所有的自然宇宙定律都表明这会影响到我们现在的日子，但所有证据表明这不对。似乎我们不能改变我们过去的理论是错的！  这表明，时间事实上不是一个箭，而是几个箭，每个箭都指向着不同的方向。从根本上讲，这证明了其他时间线的存在，即不同的维度，我们可以假设其中一些维度也建立了时空之弓。  跨过这个最终维度阈的想法实在是太诱人了。想象一下，在另一个维度的庄严科技会发明什么呢！我必须找到撕开时空结构的方法，并从成百上千不同的时间线中挖掘人类的无限潜力。",

To compensate for this, the Rover was programmed to have two distinct personalities it can switch between to have pleasant in-depth conversations with itself during long stints alone.": "侦察者是被编程的侦察机器人，用于着陆并挖掘小行星，可避免直接将复制人送往小行星而带来的不必要的危险。  侦察者与其他生物互动时的被编程为非常高兴的社交状态。然而，这种编程导致了一个意想不到的结果，它们在孤独和低士气时工作会表现出与人一样的低效率现象。  为了弥补这一点，侦察者被编程了两种能够切换的不同个性，以便在长时间单独工作时能够和它自己进行愉快的深入交流。",

  "Students at the Elion University of Science and Technology have held an unconventional party this weekend.  While their peers may have been out until the wee hours wearing lampshades on their heads and drawing eyebrows on sleeping colleagues, students Jackie Stern and Olivia Broussard spent the weekend in their dorm, refreshments and decorations ready, waiting for the arrival of the guests of honor: themselves.  The two prospective STEM students, who study theoretical physics with a focus on the workings of space time, conducted the experiment under the assumption that, were their theories about the malleability of space time to ever come to fruition, their future selves could travel back in time to greet them at the party, proving the existence of time travel.  They weren't inconsiderate of their future selves' busy schedules though; should the guests of honor be unable to attend, they were encouraged to send back a message using the codeword \"Hourglass\" to communicate that, while they certainly wanted to come, they were simply unable.  Sadly no one RSVP'd or arrived to the party, but that did not dishearten Olivia or Jackie.  As Olivia put it, \"It just meant more snacks for us!\"": "本周末，埃利昂科技大学的学生们举行了一场非传统的派对。  当其他同龄人把灯罩当帽子戴在头上，或者在熟睡的同学身上画眉毛，玩到凌晨才尽兴归来时，学生杰姬·斯特恩和奥莉维亚·布鲁萨德在宿舍度过了周末，他们准备好茶点和装饰品，等待他们尊贵的客人 - 他们自己 - 的到来。  这两位前途无限光明的理工科学生是理论物理专业的，主要从事时空领域的研究，他们的实验假设是，如果他们关于时空延展性的理论成立，那么他们未来的自己就可以穿越时间来参加派对，证明时间旅行的存在。  他们也考虑到了未来的自己可能日程安排非常繁忙，于是提出如果尊贵的客人无法出席，可以用密码\"沙漏\"发信息过来，说明他们希望能来，但实在无法脱身。  遗憾的是，最终他们没有收到回复，也没有人到场参加派对，不过这并没有使奥莉维亚和杰姬灰心丧气。  就像奥莉维亚说的，\"这对我们来说只是意味着更多零食而已！\"",

  "Filtration Mediums are materials which are supplied to some filtration buildings that are used in separating purified gases or liquids from their polluted forms.  Examples include filtering Water from Polluted Water using a Water Sieve, or a Deodorizer purifying Oxygen from Polluted Oxygen.  Filtration Mediums are a consumable that will be transformed by the filtering process to generate a by-product, like when Polluted Dirt is the result after Sand has been used to filter polluted water. The filtering building will cease to function once the filtering material has been consumed. Once the Filtering Material has been resupplied to the filtering building it will start working again.": "过滤介质是用于过滤建筑的材料，可以将污染状态的气体或液体净化。  例如，使用净水器将污染水过滤为水，或者使用空气净化器将污染氧净化为氧气。  过滤介质会在过滤过程中被消耗并转化为副产品，比如过滤污染水后沙子会变成污染土。过滤建筑在过滤材料耗尽后会停止运作，再次供应过滤材料后会重新运作。",

  "Ice is a class of materials made up mostly (if not completely) of Water in a frozen or partially frozen form.

When heated, ice will melt into its original liquified form (ie.Brine Ice will liquify into Brine). Each ice element has a different freezing and melting point based upon its composition and state.": "冰是一类主要由（如果不是完全由的话）冻结或部分冻结的水组成的材料。  作为一种低温固态或半固态的材料，这些元素可以作为低成本的方式冷却周边环境。  加热后，冰会熔化成其对应的原生液态（比如浓盐冰会熔化成浓盐水）。每种冰根据其组成和状态都有不同的熔点。",

  "Aquatic": "水域",
  "Initially there is very little solid ground in this biome to establish a temporary base, but once a transportation network can be established to send the Water of the Aquatic Biome to the rest of the colony, the other elements will be easier to reach.  Sandstone, Mafic Rock, Sand and Sedimentary Rock provide readily available construction materials for setting up elementary infrastructure. The presence of Oxylite provides invaluable Oxygen which, through careful planning, should be able to sustain any Duplicants working in the area for a limited amount of time.": "一开始这里几乎没有地面来建立一个临时基地，但是一旦能建立起将水域生态的水运向其他殖民地的运输网络，其他的需求就都是小事了。  砂石，镁铁质岩，沙子，沉积岩可作为建立基础设施的可靠的建筑材料。氧石Oxylite可以提供宝贵的氧气，通过仔细的规划，在一段时间内这些氧气维持在这个区域的复制人工作是充足的。",
  "Initial scans of this biome yield no signs of either plant life or critters. It is a land devoid of liquids and minuscule gas deposits. These dry, dusty plains can be mined for building materials but there is little in the way of life sustaining resources here for a colony.": "最初的探测表明，这片生态没有植物生命或小动物。这里缺乏液体，只有极少的气体存在。这些干而充满尘土的平地可以挖来做建筑材料，但对于一个殖民地来说，维持生命的资源很少。",
  "The layers of sedimentary rock are predominantly made up of Granite deposits, although Obsidian and Igneous Rock are also present. This suggests a history of volcanic activity, though no volcanoes exist here currently.  Veins of Iron Ore deposits are evident from initial scans, as are deposits of Coal. Both are useful in setting up a colony's power infrastructure.  Though it lacks the crucial resources necessary to sustain a colony, there is nothing inherently dangerous here to harm my Duplicants. It should be safe enough to explore.": "沉积岩层主要由花岗岩的沉积物组成，但也有黑曜石和火成岩存在。这表明了火山活动的历史，尽管现在这里已经没有火山了。  最初的扫描中也可以看出这里铁矿和煤炭矿床很丰富。这两者对于建立殖民地的电力基础很有帮助。  这里虽然缺少维持殖民地的关键的必要资源，但没有什么危险能够伤害到我的复制人。这里对于探索来说足够安全。",
  "Temperate and filled with unique Plant life, this biome contains all the necessities for life support, although not in quantities sufficient to sustain a long term colony. Exploration into neighboring biomes should be a priority.": "这片生态温和且充满了独特的植物，包含了维持生命的所有必需品，但数量不足以维持一个长期的殖民地。探索临近的生态应是优先要事。",
  "Forest": "森林",
  "Small pockets of Oxylite and Water are present in the Forest Biome, but calculations reveal they will only sustain the colony for a limited time.  Analysis shows two native plants which should be prioritized for cultivation: The Oxyfern, which releases Oxygen but requires Water; and the Arbor Tree which provides lumber as a fuel source.  A symbiotic relationship exists with the Arbor Tree and the native Pips which appear to be the only critter that can find the elusive Arbor Acorns.  This biome is really quite beautiful. I've noted that Shine Bugs and Mirth Leaf both evoke feelings of serenity in my Duplicants.": "森林生态存在小面积的氧石和水，但计算表明，它们只能维持殖民地很短时间。  分析表明，两种本地的植物应当优先种植：氧齿蕨，释放氧气但需要水；乔木树，产生作为燃料的木料。  本地的树鼠与乔木树是共生关系，它们似乎是唯一能找到乔木橡实的小动物。  这片生态真的相当漂亮。我已经注意到了发光虫和欢乐叶会唤起复制人的宁静感。",

  "Far from devoid of life, this biome contains some much needed plant life, ripe for cultivation. Sleet Wheat provides a nutrient rich ingredient for creating complex foods, though the plants do require sub-zero temperatures to thrive.  Fortunately Wheezewort can been planted on farms to lower surrounding temperatures.  Crucially, small deposits of Wolframite have been detected here. This is an extremely rare metal that should be preserved for Tungstenproduction.  Though my Duplicants appear more than happy to work in the Tundra Biome for short periods of time, I will need to provide proper equipment for them to avoid adverse affects to their well-being if they are working here for longer periods.": "这片生态并非缺乏生命，而是包含了一些必要的可种植植物。冰霜小麦可以为一些复杂的食物提供营养丰富的原料，尽管这些植物需要零下温度才能生长。  幸运的是，可以种植冰息萝卜来降低环境温度。  非常关键的是，在这里可以检测到黑钨矿。这是一种非常稀有的金属，可以存着用于钨的生产。  尽管我的复制人很乐意短时间在苔原生态工作，如果要在这里长时间工作，我还是需要为他们提供合适的装备来避免环境对他们健康的不利影响。",

  "Jungle": "丛林",
  "The Drecko is a relatively benign critter which can be domesticated to aid in textile and food production.  The Morb only function is to produce Polluted Oxygen which may be useful when establishing sustainable production loops with other critters.  Balm Lilies would be useful to cultivate for the production of critical medical materials.  Pincha Pepperplants greatly improve the nutritional and gratification of a colony's food supply. Because of their unique relationship with gravity, the plants must be orientated upside-down for proper growing. This can be accomplished by using a Farm Tile.  Given the toxic gases I will have to build proper Ventilation system to both protect my Duplicants and provide the optimum environments for the native plants and critters.": "毛鳞壁虎是一种相对温和的小动物，有助于纺织和食物的生产。  疫病章鱼唯一的作用就是产生污染氧，与其他小动物一起建立可持续的生产循环时可能会有用。  芳香百合用于生产关键的医疗材料。  火椒藤会极大地改善殖民地食物供应的营养和满足感。由于它们与重力的独特关系，这种植物必须倒置才能正常生长。可以使用农砖实现这个效果。  对于毒性气体，我可以建造合适的通风系统来保护我的复制人同时提供本地植物和小动物所需的最佳环境。",
  "Temperatures in the Magma Biome can reach upwards of 1526 degrees, making it a reliable source of extreme heat that can be exploited for the purposes of producing Power and fuel.": "岩浆生态的温度高达1526度，这是很可靠的极端热来源，可以用于产生电力和燃料。",
  "Magma is source of extreme Heat which can be used to transform Water in to Steam or Crude Oil into Petroleum. In order to prevent the extreme temperatures of this biome invading other parts of my base, suitable insulation must be constructed using materials with high melting points like  Ceramic or Obsidian.  Though Exosuits will provide some protection for my Duplicants, there is still a danger they will overheat if spending an extended amount of time in this Biome. I should ensure that suitable medical facilities have been constructed nearby to take care of any medical emergencies.": "岩浆是极端热的来源，可以用于将水转化成蒸汽，或者将原油转化成石油。为了防止极端的温度侵入我的基地我其他部分，必须使用高熔点的材料，比如陶瓷或黑曜石，建造适当的隔热层。  尽管太空服能为我的复制人提供一些保护，但长时间在这种生态中还是有过热的危险。我应该确保在附近建立适当的医疗设施，以应对任何紧急医疗情况。",
  "Polluted Oxygen dominates the atmosphere of the Marsh Biome as it escapes from the Polluted Dirt this biome is known for.": "从污染土中逸出的污染氧主宰着湿地生态的大气，正是由于这些，这种生态才众所周知。",
  "Marsh": "湿地",
  "Marsh Biomes contain large amounts of Slime which can be converted into Algae and provide a valuable resource for growing Dusk Caps as well as feeding to Pacus for producing some higher tier food.  Because of the high degree of probability that this biome will infect my Duplicants with Slimelung, it may be prudent to limit access to this area to essential activities only until my Duplicants are able to set up suitable protection.": "湿地生态包含大量菌泥，可以转化成藻类并可以为夜幕菇的生长提供宝贵的资源，还包括帕库鱼，可提供更高级的食物。  由于这种生态让我的复制人感染粘液肺病的可能性很高，可能需要慎重地建立适当的遏制区。",
  "A plethora of metals pervade the Metallic Biome making it the go-to destination for a colony ramping up production for technological advancement.": "金属生态中含有大量的金属，使其成为殖民地技术发展与生产的重要目的地。",
  "Metallic": "金属",
  "Gold Amalgam Aluminum Ore and Cobalt Ore are in abundant supply throughout this entire biome. Refining these metals with a Metal Refinery will make them available for building advanced technologies.  Though Chlorine and Hydrogen are the prevailing gasses in this biome, Oxylite exists in rock form and can provide Oxygen for Duplicants once they uncover it.  Dirt, Coal and Igneous Rock round out the rest of this biome, making it a great deposit of resources for a budding industrialized colony.": "金汞齐，铝矿，钴矿在整个生态中到处都是。使用金属精炼器将这些金属精炼就可以用于建造高级的建筑。  尽管氯气和氢气是这片生态普遍存在的气体，但氧石以岩石形态存在，一旦挖开就可以为复制人提供氧气。  泥土，煤炭和火成岩构成了这片生态剩下的部分，使其成为崭露头角的工业化殖民地的绝佳资源储备。",
  "The Moo Biome is the natural habitat of the charismatic Gassy Moo, a great source of Natural Gas.": "海牛生态是释气海牛的自然栖息地，是天然气的一种极好的来源。",
  "In addition to Natural Gas, the highly toxic Chlorine is also present in gas form. In fact, Chlorine is present here in gas, liquid, and solid states, largely due to the presence of Bleach Stone.  Igneous Rock and its denser form, Granite, provide some useful construction materials, but the real star of this biome are the Gassy Moos who consume Gas Grass and excrete Natural Gas. While Gassy Moos cannot be bred domestically, Gassy Mooteors regularly fall from space onto this biome, making it the best way to find a reliable source of these elusive creatures.  With no breathable Oxygen in this biome my Duplicants will need to be properly prepared before they venture too far into its depths.": "除了天然气，这里还充斥着氯气。实际上，氯在这里以气态，液态和固态形式存在，主要是由于漂白石的存在。  火成岩和其更密实的形式，花岗岩，可作为实用的建筑材料，但这片生态真正的重点是吃释气草排泄天然气的释气海牛。释气海牛不能繁殖，但释气海牛陨石会经常从太空降落到这片生态上，使其成为寻找这些难以捉摸的生物的最好方式。  这片生态没有氧气，所以我的复制人在深入冒险前需要充分准备。",
  "The Niobium Biome features only two resources yet, because Niobium is an extremely rare and valuable element, it is worth making a special visit.": "铌质生态只有两种资源，但因为铌是非常稀有且珍贵的资源，所以值得特别地探索一下。",
  "By itself Niobium is not a particularly useful resource, but if processed through a Metal Refinery it produces the extremely thermal conductive Thermium which goes a long way in solving many extreme temperature issues in a colony.  The edges of this biome are filled with Obsidian so a Duplicant with the Super-Duperhard Digging skill will be required before my colony can explore here.": "铌本身不是特别有用的资源，但通过分子熔炉加工，就会变成高导热性的导热质，对解决殖民地中许多极端温度的问题大有帮助。  这片生态的边缘充满着黑曜石，需要具有极坚硬材料挖掘技能的复制人才能探索到这里。",
  "Sand, Salt and Bleachstone abound in this unique briny biome.": "沙子，盐和漂白石在这个满是盐水的独特生态中比比皆是。",
  "Ocean": "海洋",
  "Pokeshell molt is an excellent source of Lime but much care must be taken with domesticating this species as it can get aggressive around its eggs.  Harvesting Waterweed provides Lettuce for many higher-tier foods.  Any water will need to be filtered through a Desalinator to remove the Salt from Water in order to be useful for my Duplicants. Luckily Table Salt can be produced using a Rock Crusher which, when combined with a Mess Table, gives my Duplicants a Morale boost.": "抛壳蟹的壳是优秀的石灰来源，但驯化抛壳蟹时要小心，它们在它们的蛋附近会表现出攻击性。  收获水草产生海生菜，用于更高级的食物。  所有水都需要通过脱盐器过滤移除水中的盐才能为我的复制人所用。幸运的是，可以通过碎石机生产食盐，放在餐桌上使用，可以提高我的复制人的士气。",
  "Viscous pools of liquid Crude Oil pepper the Carbon Dioxide rich environment of the Oil Biome.": "油质生态上闪闪发光的粘性原油池伴有丰富的二氧化碳环境。",
  "Oily": "油质",
  "Though Oxygen is more scarce in this biome, it's the perfect place to cultivate flora and fauna that thrive in CO2, such as domesticating Slicksters to create a renewable source of oil.  Diamond deposits can occasionally be found in the Oily biome, which will require a Duplicant with the Super-Duperhard Digging skill to explore properly.  Sporechids are beautiful, but should only be approached if a Duplicant is properly equipped.  While the dangers of this biome should not be underestimated, the benefits Crude Oil and Petroleum will bring to my colony far outweigh the risks.": "尽管氧气在这片生态中更稀少，但这对于生存在二氧化碳环境下的生命来说是完美场所，可以驯化浮油生物来产生可再生的原油。  钻石偶尔也可以在原油生态中找到，复制人需要极坚硬材料挖掘技能才能开采。  孢子兰很漂亮，但只有复制人装备良好才能靠近。  尽管这片生态的危险不可轻视，但原油和石油对我的殖民地带来的好处远高于风险。",
  "A highly volatile environment containing a highly useful resource, this biome is invaluable when venturing into Nuclear technologies.": "这种生态的环境高度不稳定，但含有非常有用的资源，对于核技术的探索来说是无价的。",
  "Lead Suits are imperative if my Duplicants are going to start exploring this biome as Radioactive Contaminants is a constant danger here.  Beetas pose a double threat as they are both highly radioactive and very aggressive. If they can be domesticated, however, Beeta Hives, provide a great service turning Uranium into Enriched Uranium.  While the Radioactive Biome, and the Beetas contained within it, should be avoided at all costs if my Duplicants do not have the correct protection, my colony will need to trek into this dangerous biome if we are going to build any higher tier nuclear technologies.": "如果我的复制人要开始探索这片生态，铅服是非常必要的，因为这里常有危险的放射性污染物。  辐射蜂有着双重威胁，因为它们有着高放射性同时具有攻击性。然而，辐射蜂巢如果能够被\"驯化\"，就能提供将铀变成浓缩铀的极佳作用。  如果我的复制人没有适当的防护，那就应该不惜一切代价避免接触辐射生态和其中的辐射蜂，但如果我们想要建立更高等级的核技术，我的殖民地就必须前往这片危险的生态。",
  "The Regolith Biome contains a bounty of Regolith which is very useful as a material for filtration.": "浮土生态中含有大量浮土，可用作过滤材料。",
  "Lingering within the layers of Regolith are the pernicious Shove Voles which eat valuable resources and excrete them at half the original mass.  Fortunately these pests can be wrangled up and used as a good food source for my Duplicants. However, extra care must be taken to contain these critters in pens made from either double thick walls or from Refined Metal since they are capable of burrowing through most other materials.": "在浮土层中徘徊的是可恶的锹环田鼠，它们会吃掉宝贵的资源并排出原物质的一半质量。  幸运的是，这些害兽可以抓起来作为我的复制人的食物来源。然而必须要额外注意，想要围住这些小动物就需要双倍厚墙或者精炼金属，因为它们有挖穿大多数材料的能力。",
  "The orange-brown oasis of the Rust Biome is home to many unusual flora and fauna. It contains the resources for several intermediate technologies.": "铁锈生态的橙褐色区域是许多不寻常的动植物的家园。这里包含了几种中级技术的资源。",
  "When combined with the Rust Deoxidizer, Rust can produce many of a colony's basic needs.  The Squeaky Puft, a frequent resident of the Rust biome, are a renewable source of Bleachstone and can be domesticated for such purposes.  Dreckos can also sometimes be found in these biomes, which are a great source of Phosphorite and fibre for making Textile Production  Two plants found in this biome: the Nosh Bean and the Dasha Saltvine can both produce food that will add significant Morale value for my Duplicants.": "铁锈可以通过铁锈脱氧机产生许多殖民地基本需求。  洁净飞鱼，铁锈生态的常住生物，是漂白石的可再生来源，可以将其驯化来生产。  毛鳞壁虎也可以在这些生态中找到，是磷矿和纺织生产所需的纤维重要来源。  这片生态能找到两种植物：小吃豆和沙盐藤，可以用于生产食物，较高地增加复制人的士气。",
  "The Sandstone Biome is a temperate oasis with few inherent dangers. It's the perfect spot to get your colony up and running.": "砂岩生态是温和的宜人之地，几乎没有潜在的危险。这是一个能让你的殖民地建立并运作的理想地点。",
  "Oxylite and Buried Muckroot are in sufficient supply to sustain your colony while you gather more resources.  Dirt, Algae, Copper and, of course, Sandstone provide all the materials to get basic colony essentials built.  Random Shine Bugs provide Morale boosts for my Duplicants but are not a reliable light source.  Hatch can be domesticated for food or Coal, which will be useful if using a Coal Generator for power.  All-in-all this biome is the perfect starting spot for my colony to establish a base full of essentials, from which they can then venture out and explore.": "氧石和淤泥根的量能维持你的殖民地，你可以借此获得更多资源。  泥土，藻类，铜矿，当然还有砂岩提供了建造殖民地基础必需品的所有材料。  随机的发光虫可以为我的复制人提供士气加成，但不能作为可靠的光源。  哈奇可以驯化，作为食物和煤炭来源，使用煤炭发电机发电会很有用。  总之，这片生态是建立我的殖民地的完美起点，从这里开始复制人可以慢慢向外探索。",
  "The Space Biome is located on the scenic surface of an asteroid. Watch for dazzling meteorites to shower elements down from the sky.": "太空生态位于小行星的表面。要小心从天而降的耀眼的陨石。",
  "Setting up Solar Panels on the surface will provide a source of renewable energy. However, much care must be taken to ensure Liquids or Gases are not sucked out into the Vacuum of space. Shove Voles are native to this biome, and need to be wrangled or contained or they will infest the colony.": "在地表建立太阳能板可以提供可再生能源。然而，需要注意确保液体或气体不会被吸入太空的真空中。锹环田鼠是这片生态的原始物种，需要捕捉或者控制否则会侵扰殖民地。",

  "Swamp Chard can provide adequate nutrients for my Duplicants while they establish farms, but it cannot be planted or propogated. Bog Buckets, however, provide a sweet source of nutrients that are fairly easy to farm using Polluted Water and require no extra light to grow.  Fortunately Polluted Water is abundant in this biome and will require a Liquid Filter to turn into something my Duplicants can drink. Additionally my Duplicants can use a Sludge Press to filter clean water from Mud (NOTE: Polluted Mud, however, does not make clean water).  Meanwhile, rudimentary power can be gained from the energy producing Plug Slugs that inhabit this biome.  Shiny Cobalt Ore can be found here, providing a adequate source of metal.  While much of this biome is dangerous for a new colony with some deliberate research and careful planning my Duplicants can not only survive but thrive here.": "沼泽甜菜可以提供在复制人建立农场期间提供充足的营养，但不能再次种植。相比，沼浆笼可以产生甜味的食物，使用污染水就能很容易地种植。  幸运的是，这片生态的污染水十分充足，需要液体过滤器将其中一部分转化成我的复制人能饮用的。此外，我的复制人可以使用泥浆分离器来从泥巴中滤取干净的水。（注意：污染泥不能产生干净的水）  同时，基本的电能可以由居住在这里的电弧蛞蝓提供。  这里也能找到闪闪发光的钴矿，提供了足够的金属资源。  这片生态对于新的殖民地来说有许多危险，但通过深思熟虑的研究和缜密的计划，我的复制人不仅能活下去，还能在这里繁荣。",
  "While the Wasteland Biome does not look particularly interesting, a pragmatic colony can take advantage of its selection of construction resources.": "荒地生态看起来不是特别吸引人，但一个务实的殖民地可以利用其中的建筑资源。",
  "Wasteland": "荒地",
  "The prevalance of Copper, Sandstone, Igneous Rock and its Iron rich counterpart Mafic Rock, make this a fruitful biome to explore for construction material. Sand is also in abundance here which is useful as a filtering material.  While the wildlife is not in abundance in the Wasteland Biome, the Sweetle and Grubgrub make interesting creatures to domesticate as they co-exist with the  Grubfruit Plants to produce a much higher quality food than the Spindly Grubfruit Plant found in the wild. Additionally, the Sulfur found here works both as food for the GrubGrubs and fertilizer for the Grubfruit Plants.  The abundance of Oxygen found in the Wasteland Biome makes for a low-risk area to send my Duplicants into to collect useful resources to continue with their construction projects.": "大量的铜矿，砂岩，火成岩，富铁的镁铁质岩，使其成为富产建筑材料的生态。这里也有很多沙子，可用作过滤材料。  荒地生态的野生动植物并不多，但其中的甜素甲虫和虫果果虫是很有趣的生物，它们与虫果植株共存，将它们养在一起就能产生比野外的贫瘠虫果植株更高质量的食物。此外，这里也能找到硫，作为虫果果虫的食物和虫果植株的养料。  荒地生态的氧气也十分丰富，所以对于我的复制人来说是风险较低的区域，我可以将我的复制人送去收集有用的资源并继续完成建设计划。",
